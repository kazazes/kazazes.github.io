    title: Who is this guy?
    summary: |
      I'm a political analyst, full stack developer, public speaker, and strategist. While I've worked across industries, I always end up back where I started - the intersection of politics and technology. It started with contract consulting from my bedroom, which snowballed into the first social-media-sourced polling platform, Twelect, a massively popular public opinion monitoring tool during the 2012 presidential election.
      
      On the basis of Twelect’s algorithmic technology, I started Sibyl Vision, a predict-anything public opinion analysis firm. I regularly spoke on Sibyl’s research at universities and on national television.

      As an engineer, my specialty is developing full-stack, real-time data abstraction platforms for a variety of industries, intent on exposing actionable business intelligence and consumer insight. I'm is passionate and professionally literate with regards to information security and related evolving policy.

      When I'm not on a keyboard, I'm a sailor and fisherman who is thinking about being on a keyboard.
